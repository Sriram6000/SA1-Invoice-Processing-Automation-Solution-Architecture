# Invoice Automation Architecture

This repository documents the **business problem**, **solution approaches**, and **ROI analysis** for automating invoice PDF processing in a global FMCG company operating across **20 countries** using **Microsoft Power Platform + AI Builder**.

---

## Executive Summary
- **Business Problem**: Manual invoice processing across multiple countries leads to rising costs, high error rates, SLA breaches, and weak audit trails.
- **Solution**: Three architectural patterns leveraging **Power Platform + AI Builder** to automate invoice capture, validation, exception handling, approvals, and posting.
- **Outcome**: Reduced manual effort, improved accuracy and SLA compliance, enhanced auditability, and strong ROI through phased rollout.

## Context
A global FMCG enterprise operating across **20 country** with decentralized finance opertaions. Accounts Payable team (AP) process millions of vendor invoices manually. This repository focuses on designing scalable, automated solutions for Accounts Payable (AP) invoice processing using Microsoft Power Platform and AI Builder.

## Business Problem
Manual invoice processing drives rising costs, frequent SLA breaches, high error rates, and fragmented audit trails. With invoice volumes growing rapidly, these challenges scale linearly, creating significant compliance and operational risks.
Detailed pain points, key assumptions, and impact analysis are documented in `01-business-problem/problem-statement.md`.

## Solution Approach
- Folder - `02-solution-approach/overview.md`
- Global vision with **pilot in one country**.
- Three architectural patterns using **Power Platform + AI Builder**:
  - **Pattern 1**: Low Volume / Cost-Optimized *(planned, placeholder for future content)*
      - Folder - `02-solution-approach/`
  - **Pattern 2**: Mid Volume / Balanced *(planned, placeholder for future content)*
      - Folder - `02-solution-approach/`    
  - **Pattern 3**: High Volume / Scalable & Resilient *(detailed design and diagrams)*
