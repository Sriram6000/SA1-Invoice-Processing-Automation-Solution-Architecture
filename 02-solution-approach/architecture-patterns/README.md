# Architecture Patterns

This section focuses on **Pattern 1: High Volume - Azure Blob & Functions Architecture**, as it directly supports the business problem of processing millions of invoices across 20 countries.  

To demonstrate architectural flexibility and trade-off analysis, I have also explored **two alternate patterns** considering **volume, cost, performance, scalability, and operational constraints**. These patterns provide options for organizations with different scale and complexity requirements.

## Navigation Guide
- Start with **[ High Volume - Azure Blob & Functions Architecture](01-p1-high-volume-azure-blob-functions-architecture.md)** for detailed design and diagrams.
- Review **[Mid Volume - Dataverse-Centric Architecture](02-p2-mid-volume-dataverse-centric-architecture.md) and [Low Volume - SharePoint-Based Architecture](03-p3-low-volume-sharepoint-based-architecture.md)** for alternate approaches.
- Use the **[Comparison Table](04-comparison-table.md)** to understand trade-offs and select the right pattern for your scenario.
