# Architecture Patterns

This section focuses on **Pattern 1: High Volume - Azure Blob & Functions Architecture**, as it directly supports the business problem of processing millions of invoices across 20 countries.  

To demonstrate architectural flexibility and trade-off analysis, I have also explored **two alternate patterns** considering **volume, cost, performance, scalability, and operational constraints**. These patterns provide options for organizations with different scale and complexity requirements.
