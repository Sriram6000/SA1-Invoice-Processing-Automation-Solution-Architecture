## Pattern 1 : High Volume - Azure Blob & Functions Architecture

This pattern is designed for **large-scale operations** where invoice volumes are extremely high (millions per year) across multiple countries. It focuses on **scalability, resilience, and performance**, ensuring the solution can handle global workloads efficiently while maintaining compliance and auditability.

The architecture leverages **Microsoft Power Platform** and **AI Builder** for intelligent document processing, integrated with ERP systems for seamless posting and robust audit trails.


## Business Context
- Directly addresses the **business problem** of scaling Accounts Payable for a global FMCG enterprise.
- Ensures **cost efficiency at scale** while meeting SLA and compliance requirements.
- Provides **future-ready architecture** for growth and automation maturity.

## Technical Overview
The solution pilots invoice processing automation in **one region**, with plans to **scale globally**.

**Key Components:**
- **Platform:** Microsoft Power Platform, Azure Functions, Azure Blob Storage
- **Data Ingestion:** Invoices received via email, saved to Azure Blob Storage; Azure Functions split multi-page invoices
- **Extraction:** AI Builder extracts invoice data; low-confidence cases routed for human review through Power Apps
- **Validation & Posting:** Data validated and posted to ERP via Power Automate Desktop (legacy UI automation)
- **Storage & Security:** Canonical data in Dataverse; files in Blob; credentials in Azure Key Vault
- **Observability:** Power Automate Queues and Logs, custom Power BI dashboards

## Detailed Solution Design

*   **Ingestion:** Power Automate (Outlook trigger) saves attachments to Blob and creates Dataverse: Invoice\_Staging with metadata.
*   **Split & Filter:** Azure Function (Blob trigger) splits multi-invoice PDFs, filters non-invoice pages, writes split pages to Blob, and updates Dataverse.
*   **Extraction:** Power Automate cloud flow picks ReadyForExtraction invoices, calls AI Builder, writes extracted fields and confidence scores back to Dataverse.
*   **Validation & Routing:** Business rules validate Vendor, PO match, tax math, duplicates. Low-confidence or failed rules are routed for human review.
*   **Human-in-the-loop:** Reviewer uses Power Apps to correct and approve data.
*   **ERP Posting:** PAD queue flow posts to ERP UI, updates status in Dataverse.
*   **Monitoring & Reconciliation:** Dashboards surface throughput, exceptions, confidence histograms, and latency; alerts routed to ops channel.

## Cost & Licensing Analysis

### **Scope**: 
- Pilot implementation for one region (Country A)
- Average annual invoice volume: 240,000 invoices / year
- Average monthly invoice volume: 20,000 invoices / month
- Processing assumption: 1 page per invoice (prefiltered before AI)
- Execution model (best fit): 3 customer-managed VMs with PAD

**Assumptions**
- Invoice PDFs are prefiltered so that only invoice-relevant pages are sent to AI
- AI costs are page-based, not invoice-based
- PDFs are stored in Azure Blob Storage; Dataverse stores metadata only
- 3 PAD bots are used to achieve parallelism and resilience
- Power Automate Process licenses are required per bot
- Power Apps Premium cost shown is for 1 user only and scales linearly with number of users
