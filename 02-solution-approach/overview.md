# Solution Approach Overview

## Purpose
This section outlines the overall strategy for **automating invoice processing** using **Microsoft Power Platform** and **AI Builder**. It describes the **core technical stack**, the **opportunities** we aim to address, our **global vision**, **pilot positioning and strategy**, and introduces the **architectural patterns** optimized for different volumes and operational needs.

## Core Technical Stack
- Microsoft Power Platform
- AI Builder
- Azure Services

## Opportunities Addressed
- **Cost Reduction & Scale**: Decouple workload growth from linear headcount increases; reduce manual touch by ~85%.
- **SLA Reliability**: Increase **on-time payment** rates (target ≥95%) by reducing exception cycle times and approval delays.
- **Accuracy & Exceptions**: Lower error rates (target ≤0.5%) through structured extraction, validation rules, and automated matching.
- **Auditability & Compliance**: End-to-end, immutable **audit trails** (capture → validation → exception → approval → posting).
- **Global Standardization**: Common process backbone with **localized rules** (tax, language, currency, statutory requirements).

## Global Vision
Design a **scalable, standardized** AP automation capability that:
- Supports **20-country operations** with local compliance rules.
- Provides consistent **SLA governance**, **audit trail**, and **quality** metrics.
- Enables **continuous improvement** via analytics, feedback loops, and rule tuning.

## Pilot Positioning
We will **start with one country** (pilot) to:
- Validate assumptions (volumes, field coverage, exception taxonomy, SLA thresholds).
- Refine SOPs, routing rules, and approval hierarchies.
- Prove **ROI, payback**, and operational feasibility.
- Establish templates for **repeatable rollout** to other countries.

## Pilot Strategy
- **Phase 1 — Pilot (Country A)**  
  Limited scope, controlled vendor set, clear KPIs (on-time %, error %, exceptions throughput, time-to-resolve).
- **Phase 2 — Regional Waves**  
  Roll out to clusters with similar compliance needs, reusing templates and connectors.
- **Phase 3 — Global Standardization**  
  Harmonize rules, finalize global dashboards, and scale L2/L3 **support model**.

## Architectural Patterns

- **Pattern 1: High Volume - Azure Blob & Functions Architecture**   
  - Designed for global operations with >500K invoices per year; focuses on scalability, resilience, and performance.
  - Focuses on addressing the current business problem.
  - Details are documented in [pattern-1-high-volume](architecture-patterns/01-p1-high-volume-azure-blob-functions-architecture.md)

Different volumes, cost constraints, and operating models require tailored designs. I have explored couple of additional solution architectural patterns bearing these needs:

- **Pattern 2: Mid Volume - Dataverse-Centric Architecture**
  - Balanced design for reliability and cost; modular validations and exception queues; suitable for <500K invoices/year.
  - Details are documented in [pattern-2-mid-volume](architecture-patterns/02-p2-mid-volume-dataverse-centric-architecture.md)
  
- **Pattern 3: Low Volume - SharePoint-Based Architecture**
  - Minimal infrastructure footprint, simplified routing, pragmatic storage, cost-optimized; suitable for <2k invoices/year.
  - Details are documented in [pattern-3-low-volume](architecture-patterns/03-p3-low-volume-sharepoint-based-architecture.md)

- **Comparison Table (Trade-offs)**  
  - Side-by-side view of differnt factors.
  - Details are documented in [comparison-table](./architecture-patterns/04-comparison-table.md)

## Navigation Guide
- Read this **Overview** to understand the direction, stack, and rollout plan.
- Open **[Architecure Patterns](./architecture-patterns/)** to examine designs tailored to your volume and constraints.
- Refer to the **[Comparison Table](./architecture-patterns/04-comparison-table.md)** for decision‑making across cost, performance, and scalability.
