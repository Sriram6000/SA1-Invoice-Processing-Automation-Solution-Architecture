# Solution Approach Overview

## Purpose
This section outlines the overall strategy for **automating invoice processing** using **Microsoft Power Platform** and **AI Builder**. It describes the **core technical stack**, the **opportunities** we aim to address, our **global vision**, **pilot positioning and strategy**, and introduces the **architectural patterns** optimized for different volumes and operational needs.

---

## Core Technical Stack
- Microsoft Power Platform
- AI Builder
- Azure Services

---

## Opportunities Addressed
- **Cost Reduction & Scale**: Decouple workload growth from linear headcount increases; reduce manual touch by ~85%.
- **SLA Reliability**: Increase **on-time payment** rates (target ≥95%) by reducing exception cycle times and approval delays.
- **Accuracy & Exceptions**: Lower error rates (target ≤0.5%) through structured extraction, validation rules, and automated matching.
- **Auditability & Compliance**: End-to-end, immutable **audit trails** (capture → validation → exception → approval → posting) across 20 countries.
- **Global Standardization**: Common process backbone with **localized rules** (tax, language, currency, statutory requirements).

---

## Global Vision
Design a **scalable, standardized** AP automation capability that:
- Supports **20-country operations** with local compliance rules.
- Provides consistent **SLA governance**, **audit trail**, and **quality** metrics.
- Enables **continuous improvement** via analytics, feedback loops, and rule tuning.

---

## Pilot Positioning
We will **start with one country** (pilot) to:
- Validate assumptions (volumes, field coverage, exception taxonomy, SLA thresholds).
- Refine SOPs, routing rules, and approval hierarchies.
- Prove **ROI, payback**, and operational feasibility.
- Establish templates for **repeatable rollout** to other countries.

---

## Pilot Strategy
- **Phase 1 — Pilot (Country A)**  
  Limited scope, controlled vendor set, clear KPIs (on-time %, error %, exceptions throughput, time-to-resolve).
- **Phase 2 — Regional Waves**  
  Roll out to clusters with similar compliance needs, reusing templates and connectors.
- **Phase 3 — Global Standardization**  
  Harmonize rules, finalize global dashboards, and scale L2/L3 **support model**.

## Architectural Patterns
Different volumes, cost constraints, and operating models require tailored designs. Explore the patterns below:

- **Pattern 1: Low Volume / Cost-Optimized** *(planned)*  
  Minimal infrastructure footprint, simplified routing, pragmatic storage; suitable for <100k invoices/year.
  - File: `./architecture-patterns/pattern-1-low-volume.md`

- **Pattern 2: Mid Volume / Balanced** *(planned)*  
  Balanced design for reliability and cost; modular validations and exception queues; suitable for ~100k–1M invoices/year.
  - File: `./architecture-patterns/pattern-2-mid-volume.md`

- **Pattern 3: High Volume / Scalable** *(detailed)*  
  Parallelized extraction, resilient queues, regionalized workloads; suitable for >1M invoices/year globally.
  - File: [`./architecture-patterns/pattern-3-high-volumemd`

- **Comparison Table (Trade-offs)**  
  Side-by-side view of cost, throughput, SLA reliability, ops complexity, and scalability.
  - File: [`./rchitecture-patterns/comparison-table.md`

## Navigation Guide
- Read this **Overview** to understand the direction, stack, and rollout plan.
- Open **Patterns** to examine designs tailored to your volume and constraints.
- Refer to the **Comparison Table** for decision‑making across cost, performance, and scalability.
