## Problem Statement
The Accounts Payable (AP) team at GobalCrop Ltd. manages end‑to‑end invoice processing for a large, diversified supplier base.

The current operating model of AP activities are largely manual, including invoice capture, validation against POs, coding, exception handling, QC sampling, approvals routing, and posting to ERP system. The model relies on 24/7 staffing across time zones, with localized process variations due to tax, language, currency, and compliance differences. As volumes rise, costs, errors, and SLA risks rise with them.

## **Current Challenges**

**1. High Volume and Growth Pressure**
- Millions of invoices annually across 20 countries; growth expected at ~20–30% YoY.
- Manual processes scale with headcount, creating a cost bottleneck and hiring pressure.

**2. Operational Complexity**
- **24/7 operations** across regions with varying tax and statutory requirements.
- Language, currency, and document variety increase handling time and exception rates.

**3. Rising Cost and Resource Burden**
- Large FTE footprint in core processing, QC sampling, and rework.
- Indirect costs: management overhead, training/attrition, infra.
- **SLA breaches ~7-10%** trigger penalties and vendor friction.

**4. Quality and Risk Exposure**
- Manual error rates of **~2–3%** drive rework, delayed payments, and disputes.
- Inconsistent SLA adherence impacts cash predictability and supplier trust.
- Limited global visibility and process control increase compliance risk.

## **Impact:**
- **Escalating run-rate** as volumes grow; costs rise linearly with staffing.
- **Operational fragility** (shift coverage, attrition, training burden).
- **Finance credibility risk** due to SLA breaches, disputes, and delayed payouts.
- **Opportunity cost**: skilled staff tied to low-value transactional work.

## **Key Parameters Driving the Problem**

- **Global invoice volume**: high and **accelerating** with business expansion with 20-30% increase YOY.
- **FTE footprint: hundreds** dedicated to AP across 20 countries.
- **Error rate: 2–3%** in manual models, significant rework burden.
- **SLA breach: 15–25% of invoices** see a breach event across regions.
- **Cost trajectory**: rising YoY with no scale efficiency.

# **Why this matters and must be addressed**

- **Supplier experience risk:** Errors and delays affect supply continuity and pricing.
- **Compliance & reputational exposure:** Multi-jurisdictional penalties and audits.
- **Strategic misalignment:** Finance should drive insights and working capital—not manual data entry.
- **Weak Audit Trail:** Manual processes create fragmented or incomplete audit logs, increasing compliance risk and making audits time-consuming and costly.

# **Business Driver for Automation**

- **Scalability:** Decouple cost from volume growth; absorb increases without linear FTE adds.
- **Accuracy:** Reduce error rate sharply for fewer disputes and faster cycle times.
- **SLA Reliability:** Minimize breaches and penalty exposure.
- **Global Standardization:** Central controls with local compliance.
- **Measurable ROI:** Tangible cost-out, quality improvements, and vendor experience gains.
- **Enhanced Auditability and Compliance:** Ensure a complete, tamper-proof audit trail for every invoice action, meeting regulatory requirements.
