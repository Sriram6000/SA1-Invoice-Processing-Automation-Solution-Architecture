With the current manual opertating model, the AP teams projects its organization’s scale and costs to evolve and as follows:

   |Period|Annual Invoice<br/> Volume|FTE Count|Annual Errors|Delayed Payments<br/> (SLA Breaches)|Annual Cost <br/>(USD)|
   |------|---------------------|--|--|--|--|
   | Last Year | 3,840,000 | 229 | 96,000 | 768,000 | $ 9,142,857 |
   | This Year | 4,800,000 | 286 |120,000 | 960,000 | $ 11,428,571 |
   | Next Year | 6,000,000 | 357 |150,000 | 1,200,000 | $ 14,285,714 |
   | Year After Next | 7,500,000 | 446 | 187,500 | 1,500,000 | $ 17,857,143 |


> [!NOTE]
> **Derivation Notes**
> - **Annual Invoice Volume**
>     -  Total invoices processed globally across 20 countries. Growth modeled at **+25% YoY**.
> - **FTE Count**
>     -  Based on **6 minutes per invoice** and **1,680 productive hours per FTE/year** (7 hours a day X 20 days a month X 12 months).
>     -  Formula: `FTE = (Invoices × 6 ÷ 60) ÷ 1,680 = Invoices ÷ 16,800`
> - **Annual Errors**
>     -  Error rate of **2.5%** on an average.
>     -  Formula: `Errors = Invoices × 0.025`
> - **Delayed Payments (SLA Breaches)**
>     -  Modeled as 20% of invoices paid late.
>     -  Formula: `SLA Breaches = Invoices × 0.20`
> - **Annual Cost (USD)**
>     -  Direct labor cost only (core processing).
>     -  Formula: `Cost = FTE × $40,000 (blended global cost)`

> [!CAUTION]
> This table excludes QC sampling, rework hours, overhead, technology, and penalties — actual costs will be higher.
