## Executive Summary

The Shared-Finance team at GlobalCorp Ltd. faces high manual effort, error rates, and compliance risks in supplier invoice processing. This solution proposes a Power Platform-based automation pilot to reduce processing costs by 60–80%, improve accuracy, and enable global scalability, following Microsoft’s Well-Architected Framework.

***

## Business Problem

With operations in 20 countries, the Shared-Finance team manages a large, decentralized supplier ecosystem and processes over 10,000 invoices per month.

*   **Current State:** 100% manual invoice processing (8–10 min/invoice, 3–7% error rate, volume spikes).
*   **Pain Points:** High FTE cost, SLA breaches, compliance gaps, poor scalability.

**Objective:**  
Accelerate invoice processing, minimize manual intervention and touchpoints, reduce errors and escalations, optimize overall costs, and enhance auditability—while establishing a scalable, enterprise-wide automation framework that can be extended across regions and business units.

***

## Opportunity

Automation presents a strong business opportunity to:

*   Reduce processing cost by 60–80%
*   Eliminate manual transcription errors
*   Free up tens of thousands of labour hours annually
*   Reduce dependency on temporary staffing
*   Improve SLA adherence and predictability
*   Scale globally using a standardized invoice-processing model
*   Enable faster and cleaner financial close cycles

***

## Solution Overview

The solution pilots invoice processing automation in one region, with plans to scale globally.

*   **Platform:** Microsoft Power Platform, Azure Functions, Azure Blob Storage
*   **Data Ingestion:** Invoices received via email, saved to Azure Blob Storage, Azure Functions split multi-paged invoices
*   **Extraction:** AI Builder extracts invoice data; low-confidence cases routed for human review through Power Apps
*   **Validation & Posting:** Data validated, posted to ERP via PAD (legacy UI automation)
*   **Storage & Security:** Canonical data in Dataverse; files in Blob; credentials in Azure Key Vault
*   **Observability:** Power Automate Queues and Logs, custom Power BI dashboards

**Single-region pilot benefits:**

*   Lower initial complexity
*   Faster delivery and validation
*   Easier compliance approvals
*   Ability to refine extraction models with local invoice samples
*   Reduced infrastructure and licensing footprint during early stages

## Detailed Solution Design

*   **Ingestion:** Power Automate (Outlook trigger) saves attachments to Blob and creates Dataverse: Invoice\_Staging with metadata.
*   **Split & Filter:** Azure Function (Blob trigger) splits multi-invoice PDFs, filters non-invoice pages, writes split pages to Blob, and updates Dataverse.
*   **Extraction:** Power Automate cloud flow picks ReadyForExtraction invoices, calls AI Builder, writes extracted fields and confidence scores back to Dataverse.
*   **Validation & Routing:** Business rules validate Vendor, PO match, tax math, duplicates. Low-confidence or failed rules are routed for human review.
*   **Human-in-the-loop:** Reviewer uses Power Apps to correct and approve data.
*   **ERP Posting:** PAD queue flow posts to ERP UI, updates status in Dataverse.
*   **Monitoring & Reconciliation:** Dashboards surface throughput, exceptions, confidence histograms, and latency; alerts routed to ops channel.
