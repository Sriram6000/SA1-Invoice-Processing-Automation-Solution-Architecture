# Sensitivity Cases

The purpose of this section is to show how ROI varies with different assumptions to reflect uncertainty and risk.

## Scenarios to Test
- Volume growth: ±10–30%
- License cost: $0.02–$0.05 per invoice
- Residual minutes: 0.7–1.2 min/invoice
- Post‑automation SLA late %: 3–7% (monetory value pending)

## Result Summary
| Case                         | Payback (yrs) | 3‑Year Savings | Notes |
|------------------------------|---------------|----------------|-------|
| Base Case                    | < 1           | $42.23M        | Residual 0.9 min; license $0.03; infra $150k; support $240k; capex Y1 $350k. |
| Higher license ($0.05)       | < 1           | $41.79M        |  Same as base, but license $0.05/invoice. Savings drop modestly; still stellar.     |
| Lower reduction (70%)        | < 1             | $34.32M              |  Residual = 1.8 min (only 70% automation). Savings shrink materially; still pays back inside Year 1.     |
| Residual mins 1.2            | < 1             | $39.59M              |  Equivalent to ~80% reduction. Strong but visibly worse than base     |

## What Moves the Needle
- **Residual minutes/invoice** and **license rate** materially impact ROI.
- **Labor cost** and **volume growth** also drive savings magnitude.
