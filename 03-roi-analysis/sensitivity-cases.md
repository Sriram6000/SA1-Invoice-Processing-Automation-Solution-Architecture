# Sensitivity Cases

The purpose of this section is to show how ROI varies with different assumptions to reflect uncertainty and risk.

## Scenarios to Test
- Volume growth: ±10–30%
- License cost: $0.02–$0.05 per invoice
- Residual minutes: 0.7–1.2 min/invoice
- Post‑automation SLA late %: 3–7%
- Labor cost (FTE): $35k–$55k
- Discount rate (NPV): 8–12%

## Result Summary (Template)
| Case                         | Payback (yrs) | 3‑Year Savings | Notes |
|------------------------------|---------------|----------------|-------|
| Base Case                    | < 1           | $42.23M        | As per assumptions |
| Higher license ($0.05)       | …             | …              |       |
| Lower reduction (70%)        | …             | …              |       |
| Residual mins 1.2            | …             | …              |       |
| SLA late 7%                  | …             | …              |       |

## What Moves the Needle
- **Residual minutes/invoice** and **license rate** materially impact ROI.
- **Labor cost** and **volume growth** also drive savings magnitude.
