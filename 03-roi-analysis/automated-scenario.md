# Automated Scenario — Pattern 1 (High Volume)

Model the **target-state run‑rate** when Pattern 1 is implemented, including residual labor, licenses, infra, support, and one‑time capex.

## Improvement Levers

- Manual minutes ↓ **85%** → residual **0.9 min/invoice**
- Error rate ↓ **2.5% → 0.5%**
- SLA late ↓ **20% → ≤5%**
- New costs: **License**, **Infra**, **Support FTEs**, **Capex (Year 1)**

## Key Formulas

> Residual Minutes/Invoice = 6 × (1 - 0.85) = 0.9

> FTE_auto = (Invoices × 0.9 / 60) / 1,680

> License Cost = Invoices × $0.03

> Support Cost = 6 × $40,000 = $240,000

> Total Auto Cost (Yr 1) = Residual Labor + License + Infra + Support + Capex

> Total Auto Cost (Yr 2+) = Residual Labor + License + Infra + Support

> Assumes infra and support are fairly stable across years; adjust by country rollout if needed.
