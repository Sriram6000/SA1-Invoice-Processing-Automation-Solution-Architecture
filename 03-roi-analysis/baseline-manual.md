# Baseline — Manual 

The purpose of this section is to establish the **current run‑rate** of manual Account Payable's operations to quantify the "cost of doing nothing".

## Key Formulas

> FTE_manual = (Invoices × 6 / 60) / 1,680 = Invoices / 16,800

> Manual Cost (Direct Labor) = FTE_manual × $40,000

> Errors = Invoices × 2.5%

> Delayed Payments (Late) = Invoices × 20%

## Year-by-Year Snapshot

| Period           | Annual Invoices | FTE | Errors (# & %)   | Delayed Payments (# & %) | **Direct Labor Cost (USD)** |
|------------------|----------------:|-----------:|------------------:|--------------------------:|----------------------------:|
| Last Year        | 3,840,000       | 229        | 96,000 (2.5%)     | 768,000 (20%)             | **$9,142,857**              |
| This Year        | 4,800,000       | 286        | 120,000 (2.5%)    | 960,000 (20%)             | **$11,428,571**             |
| Next Year        | 6,000,000       | 357        | 150,000 (2.5%)    | 1,200,000 (20%)           | **$14,285,714**             |
| Year After Next  | 7,500,000       | 446        | 187,500 (2.5%)    | 1,500,000 (20%)           | **$17,857,143**             |

> Note: Costs shown are **direct labor only** to keep the baseline conservative. QC, rework, overhead, and penalties would increase total cost further.
