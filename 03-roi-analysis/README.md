## How to Read This
1. Start with **[Assumptions](./assumptions.md)** (operational & financial drivers).
2. Review **[Manual Baseline](./cost-of-baseline-manual.md)** to understand the “cost of doing nothing.”
3. See **[Automated Scenario](./cost-of-automated-scenario.md)** for the target-state cost model.
4. Use **[Savings & ROI](./savings-and-roi.md)** for payback, 3‑year savings, and (optionally) NPV/IRR.
5. Check **[Sensitivity](./sensitivity-cases.md)** to see how results vary under different conditions.

> **Auditability:** Beyond cost, automation delivers **complete, tamper‑proof audit trails** across capture → validation → approvals → posting. This materially reduces compliance risk and audit effort and should be highlighted in business discussions.
